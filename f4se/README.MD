F4SE for VR is in this folder due to the absense of a F4SEVR source on github which means it cannot be used as a dependency repo. There are modifications included that are from repo https://github.com/rollingrock/Fallout-4-VR-Body/.

https://f4se.silverlock.org/ distributes compiled F4SEVR.

The readme stipulates:
```
* Can I redistribute or make modified versions of F4SE?
 - No. The suggested method for extending F4SE is to write a plugin. If this does not meet your needs, please email the contact addresses listed below.
```

The f4se license (included in the F4SE installer package) states:
```
THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED "AS IS", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.

```

This git repo does not provide modified versions of F4SE or F4SEVR. The modified F4SEVR source files included in this F4SEVR source are only to enable build of the primary package in this repo. This does not appear to contradict the statements on https://f4se.silverlock.org/ and is here in good faith.
